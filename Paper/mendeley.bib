abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: Contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: Increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: Two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: ELOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23{\%} points above the change in annual demand, to 103 GW in Germany and 92 GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

abstract = {The unbundling of formerly vertically integrated utilities in liberalized electricity markets led to a coordination problem between investments in the regulated electricity grid and investments into new power generation. At the same time investments into new generation capacities based on weather dependent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy are increasingly subsidized with different support schemes. Against this backdrop this article analyzes the locational choice of private wind power investors under different support schemes and the implications on grid investments. I find that investors do not choose system optimal locations in feed-in tariff schemes, feed-in premium schemes and subsidy systems with direct capacity payments. Consequently, inefficiencies arise if transmission investment follows wind power investment. A benevolent transmission operator can implement the first-best solution by anticipatory investment behavior, which is however only applicable under perfect regulation. Alternatively a location dependent network charge for wind power producers can directly influence investment decisions and internalize the grid integration costs of wind power generation.},

abstract = {Governments occupy a significant proportion of building stock and their associated annual water and energy costs can be substantive. Research has shown that significant reductions in energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions can be achieved through retrofitting public buildings. However, in most countries the current retrofitting rate is very low due to a number of barriers, including a lack of supportive legislation, regulations, guidelines, industry capacity and financial mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the barriers as well as the best international practices covering numerous aspects of public building retrofits. Among others, the most important barriers identified were a lack of consideration of the water-energy nexus, and the limited availability of effective financing mechanisms. With a particular focus on the Australian context, a strategic roadmap, as well as a number of recommendations, such as the use of revolving loan fund financing and energy performance procurement, have been developed that aim to foster a greater rate of implementation of energy and water retrofit projects for public buildings. Achievement of such an aim will not only reduce ongoing operational costs of public buildings, but also lower their environmental impact and generate new employment opportunities.},

   abstract = {Development of accurate transposition models to simulate plane-of-array (POA) irradiance from horizontal measurements or simulations is a complex process mainly because of the anisotropic distribution of diffuse solar radiation in the atmosphere. The limited availability of reliable POA measurements at large temporal and spatial scales leads to difficulties in the comprehensive evaluation of transposition models. This paper proposes new algorithms to assess the uncertainty of transposition models using both surface-based observations and modeling tools. We reviewed the analytical derivation of POA irradiance and the approximation of isotropic diffuse radiation that simplifies the computation. Two transposition models are evaluated against the computation by the rigorous analytical solution. We proposed a new algorithm to evaluate transposition models using the clear-sky measurements at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) and a radiative transfer model that integrates diffuse radiances of various sky-viewing angles. We found that the radiative transfer model and a transposition model based on empirical regressions are superior to the isotropic models when compared to measurements. We further compared the radiative transfer model to the transposition models under an extensive range of idealized conditions. Our results suggest that the empirical transposition model has slightly higher cloudy-sky POA irradiance than the radiative transfer model, but performs better than the isotropic models under clear-sky conditions. Significantly smaller POA irradiances computed by the transposition models are observed when the photovoltaics (PV) panel deviates from the azimuthal direction of the sun. The new algorithms developed in the current study have opened the door to a more comprehensive evaluation of transposition models for various atmospheric conditions and solar and PV orientations.},

   abstract = {Radiative transfer (RT) models simulating broadband solar radiation have been widely used by atmospheric scientists to model solar resources for various energy applications such as operational forecasting. Due to the complexity of solving the RT equation, the computation under cloudy conditions can be extremely time consuming though many approximations (e.g. two-stream approach and delta-M truncation scheme) have been utilized. Thus, a more efficient RT model is crucial for model developers as a new option for approximating solar radiation at the land surface with minimal loss of accuracy. In this study, we developed a fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) using the simplified clear-sky RT model, REST2, and simulated cloud transmittances and reflectances from Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM) with a sixteen-stream Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT). Simulated lookup tables (LUTs) of cloud transmittances and reflectances are created by varying cloud optical thicknesses, cloud particle sizes, and solar zenith angles. Equations with optimized parameters are fitted to the cloud transmittances and reflectances to develop the model. The all-sky solar irradiance at the land surface can then be computed rapidly by combining REST2 with the cloud transmittances and reflectances. This new RT model is more than 1000 times faster than those currently utilized in solar resource assessment and forecasting since it does not explicitly solve the RT equation for each individual cloud condition. Our results indicate the accuracy of the fast radiative transfer model is comparable to or better than two-stream approximation in term of computing cloud transmittance and solar radiation.},

BIPVs are divided into different groups, PV-sunshade (PVSDS) type of which is targeted in present study. PVSDS can be used in residential buildings to contribute significantly to the economic costs of the building by saving the building's electricity consumption. The use of solar panels in buildings is useful when it is economically viable. For this purpose, in this study, a multi-objective optimization is performed to simultaneously reduce the annual cost of electricity consumption and the cost of installing window glass and PV system by applying photovoltaic shadows installed on the building window. To initiate multi-objective optimization, six design variables based on the position and geometry of the photovoltaic shade are selected and energy simulations are performed through EnergyPlus software for 5 cities with different climates in Europe. Design variables and objective functions are identified in JEPLUS (Java+ EnergyPlus) software, then the NSGA-II algorithm is employed for optimization which results in the several optimal points on a Pareto Front. Based on the climatic condition of the city, a specific optimal point on the Pareto Front is attributed to that city. The results show that 17 to 34 % in the cost of electricity consumption of the building is saved by choosing a suitable solar shading between. Also, the static payback period is obtained in a period of 1.5 to 6 years for different cities. It is also construed that the tilt angle of PV shading in cities that are further from the equator is higher.},

Building-based electricity storage - to enable demand response (DR) without curtailing actual appliance usage - offers potential benefits of lower electricity production cost, higher grid reliability, and more flexibility to integrate renewables. DR tariffs are currently available in the U.S. but building-based storage is still underutilized due to insufficiently understood cost-effectiveness and dispatch strategies. Whether DR schemes can yield a profit for building operators (i.e., reduction in electricity bill that exceeds levelized storage cost) and which particular storage technology yields the highest profit is yet to be answered. This study aims to evaluate the economics of providing peak shaving DR under a realistic tariff (Con Edison, New York), using a range of storage technologies (conventional and advanced batteries, flywheel, magnetic storage, pumped hydro, compressed air, and capacitors). An agent-based stochastic model is used to randomly generate appliance-level demand profiles for an average U.S. household. We first introduce a levelized storage cost model which is based on a total-energy-throughput lifetime. We then develop a storage dispatch strategy which optimizes the storage capacity and the demand limit on the grid. We find that (i) several storage technologies provide profitable DR; (ii) annual profit from such DR can range from 1% to 39% of the household's non-DR electricity bill; (iii) allowing occasional breaches of the intended demand limit increases profit; and (iv) a dispatch strategy that accounts for demand variations across seasons increases profit further. We expect that a more advanced dispatch strategy with embedded weather forecasting capability could yield even higher profit.},

   abstract = {The need for a more flexible usage of power is increasing due to the electrification of new sectors in society combined with larger amounts of integrated intermittent electricity production in the power system. Among other cities, Uppsala in Sweden is undergoing an accelerated transition of its vehicle fleet from fossil combustion engines to electrical vehicles. To meet the requirements of the transforming mobility infrastructure, Uppsala municipality has, in collaboration with Uppsala University, built a full-scale commercial electrical vehicle parking garage equipped with a battery storage and photovoltaic system. This paper presents the current hardware topology of the parking garage, a neural network for day-ahead predictions of the parking garage’s load profile, and a simulation model in MATLAB using rule-based peak shaving control. The created neural network was trained on data from 2021 and its performance was evaluated using data from 2022. The performance of the rule-based peak shaving control was evaluated using the predicted load demand and photovoltaic data collected for the parking garage. The aim of this paper is to test a prediction model and peak shaving strategy that could be implemented in practice on-site at the parking garage. The created neural network has a linear regression index of 0.61, which proved to yield a satisfying result when used in the rule-based peak shaving control with the parking garage’s 60 kW/137 kWh battery system. The peak shaving model was able to reduce the highest load demand peak of 117 kW by 38.6% using the forecast of a neural network.},

@article{Castellucci2022,
   abstract = {The electrification of the transport sector is of crucial importance for a successful transition to a fossil-free society. However, the electricity grid constitutes a bottleneck. This article provides a case study based on a real-world parking garage with a smart grid infrastructure, called Dansmästaren. The analysis shows how renewable energy sources, energy storage technologies, and smart charging of electric vehicles can smooth out the load curve of the parking garage and relieve the electric grid during peak hours. Dansmästaren is located in Uppsala, Sweden, and equipped with 60 charging points for electric vehicles, a PV system, and a battery storage system. The study utilizes an energy flow model to show the potential of a realistically dimensioned smart energy system, that can benefit the parking facility in itself and the local distribution grid in a city, Uppsala, with grid capacity challenges. The results suggest that the parking garage demand on the local grid can be significantly lowered by smarter control of its relatively small battery energy storage. Moreover, further smart control strategies can decrease demand up to 60% during high load hours while still guaranteeing fully charged vehicles at departure in near future scenarios. The study also shows that peak shaving strategies can lower the maximum peaks by up to 79%. A better understanding of the potential of public infrastructures for electric vehicle charging helps to increase knowledge on how they can contribute to more sustainable cities and a fossil-free society.},

@article{Wood2023,
   abstract = {Optimal behind-the-meter energy management often requires a day-ahead electric load forecast capable of learning non-linear and non-stationary patterns, due to the spatial disaggregation of loads and concept drift associated with time-varying physics and behavior. There are many promising machine learning techniques in the literature, but black box models lack explainability and therefore confidence in the models’ robustness can’t be achieved without thorough testing on data sets with varying and representative statistical properties. Therefore this work adopts and builds on some of the highest-performing load forecasting tools in the literature, which are Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks, Empirical Mode Decomposition for feature engineering, and k-means clustering for outlier detection, and tests a combined methodology on seven different load data sets from six different load sectors. Forecast test set results are benchmarked against a seasonal naive model and SARIMA. The resultant skill scores range from −6.3% to 73%, indicating that the methodology adopted is often but not exclusively effective relative to the benchmarks.},

abstract = {State of Charge (SOC) estimation is vital for battery management systems (BMS), impacting battery efficiency and lifespan. Accurate SOC estimation is challenging due to battery complexity and limited data for training Machine Learning based models. Transfer learning (TL) leverages pre-trained models, reducing training time and improving generalization in SOC estimation. In this paper, 8 different transfer learning techniques are examined, which were applied in four different models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU) for SOC estimation. These transfer learning techniques have been applied to three datasets for re-training the models and results have been compared with the same models defined by Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. The TL4 and TL5 techniques consistently stood out as among the most efficient in both accuracy and computational time.},

abstract = {The performance of bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) modules under various operating conditions needs to be analyzed with research and development activities. This research work performed an experimental comparison of the energy performance of a bPV module and a monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) module, based on experimental data measured at SolarTechLAB, Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano. For this purpose, the performance ratio (PR) and the temperature-corrected PR proposed by the IEC 61724-1 standard for bPV and mPV modules were evaluated. To calculate the energy improvement of the technology in terms of bifacial gain, measurements were recorded during the period from 8 June to 31 November, 2022, of PV modules facing south, ground-mounted and with a low albedo. It was found that the PR relative gain of the bPV compared with the mPV module is 10.8{\%} higher in the whole period. Moreover, the presence of a commercial white plastic sheet with high reflectivity located beneath the bPV modules from 28 May to 5 June, 2022, showed an additional increase in the bPV PR of 0.0165, corresponding to a relative difference increased by 20{\%}.},

A sample population of buildings was generated, a techno-economic optimization model was used to size and dispatch the BESS, and the resulting optimal BESS sizes were analyzed for relevant predictor variables. Explanatory regression analyses were used to demonstrate that, of the variables considered, peak demand charges are the most significant predictor of an economically viable battery, and that the shape of the load profile is the most significant predictor of the size of the battery.},
